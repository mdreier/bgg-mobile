# BoardGameGeek Mobile
A mobile application for BoardGameGeek.

## Why?
This is my first forage into [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Instead of just writing a typical Hello World application I noticed that there is no native app for [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/). The first use case is to manage your boardgame collection through the app. Depending on my motivation I may add further usages.

## What?
The main purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application using Reach Native. A secondary result will be an at least partial reverse engineering of the JSON API used by the BoardGameGeek website which will be used for communication by the app.

## What not?
This project is not official at all and in no way affiliated with BoardGameGeek, Geekdo, or BoardGameGeek, Ltd.

## How?
Apps will be built on [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/).
